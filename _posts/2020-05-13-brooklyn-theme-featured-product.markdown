Brooklyn theme featured product section on Homepage  will not display the product gallery and description by default. You can display both by customizing `sections/featured-product.liquid` . 

Always try these changes on a duplicate theme first. Current Brooklyn version is `16.0.5` 

Replace the entire code inside `sections/featured-product.liquid` with this [Gist] [gist-link] and Save.
